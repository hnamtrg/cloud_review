    const allQuizData = [{"question": "<p>A company is looking to protect data stored on S3 via a solution that supports lifecycle management and audit for the cryptographic key material used for encryption of data on S3.</p>\n<p>Which of the following options represents the best solution with the least development and maintenance effort?</p>\n", "answers": ["Use Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) for encrypting objects in Amazon S3 buckets", "Use AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) for encrypting objects in Amazon S3 buckets", "Use Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) for encrypting objects in Amazon S3 buckets", "Use client-side encryption to have full control over encryption and decryption process"], "correct_answer": "Use AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) for encrypting objects in Amazon S3 buckets", "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) for encrypting objects in Amazon S3 buckets</strong> - When you use server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), you can use the default AWS managed CMK, or you can specify a customer-managed CMK that you have already created. If you want to use a customer-managed CMK for SSE-KMS, create the CMK before you configure SSE-KMS. Then, when you configure SSE-KMS for your bucket, specify the existing customer-managed CMK.</p>\n<p>Creating your own customer-managed CMK gives you more flexibility and control. For example, you can create, rotate, and disable customer-managed CMKs. You can also define access controls and audit the customer-managed CMKs that you use to protect your data. You can use AWS KMS to manage the lifecycle of the key material within AWS.</p>\n<p>When you configure server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), you can configure your bucket to use S3 Bucket Keys for SSE-KMS. This bucket-level key for SSE-KMS can reduce your KMS request costs by up to 99 percent by decreasing the request traffic from Amazon S3 to AWS KMS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-soa-pt/assets/pt4-q1-i1.jpg\"/>\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/kms-best-practices/aws-managed-and-customer-managed-cmks.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/kms-best-practices/aws-managed-and-customer-managed-cmks.html</a></p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) for encrypting objects in Amazon S3 buckets</strong> - Server-side encryption protects data at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a key that it rotates regularly. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available to encrypt your data, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256).</p>\n<p>There are no new charges for using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3). However, requests to configure and use SSE-S3 incur standard Amazon S3 request charges. Audit trail and lifecycle management is not possible with SSE-S3. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) for encrypting objects in Amazon S3 buckets</strong> - Using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) allows you to set your own encryption keys. With the encryption key you provide as part of your request, Amazon S3 manages the encryption as it writes to disks and decryption when you access your objects.</p>\n<p>When you upload an object, Amazon S3 uses the encryption key you provide to apply AES-256 encryption to your data and removes the encryption key from memory. When you retrieve an object, you must provide the same encryption key as part of your request. Amazon S3 first verifies that the encryption key you provided matches and then decrypts the object before returning the object data to you. In SSE-C, the customer needs to manage and maintain encryption keys and decryption keys, which are passed with every request. Although you could develop a solution on client side that supports lifecycle management and audit for the cryptographic key material, however, it would take significant development and maintenance time. Hence this option is not the right fit for the given use case.</p>\n<p><strong>Use client-side encryption to have full control over encryption and decryption process</strong> - Server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it. Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it.</p>\n<p>Whereas, in client-side Encryption, you encrypt data on the client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools. The given use case mandates that the encryption should happen on S3, so this option is ruled out.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/kms-best-practices/aws-managed-and-customer-managed-cmks.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/kms-best-practices/aws-managed-and-customer-managed-cmks.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingEncryption.html</a></p>\n", "section": "Domain 4: Security and Compliance", "type": "radio"}, {"question": "<p>Account A has enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects into an Amazon S3 bucket.

Access points are unique hostnames that customers create to enforce distinct permissions and network controls for any request made through the access point. Customers with shared data sets including data lakes, media archives, and user-generated content can easily scale access for hundreds of applications by creating individualized access points with names and permissions customized for each application. Any access point can be restricted to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to firewall S3 data access within customers’ private networks, and AWS Service Control Policies can be used to ensure all access points are VPC restricted. S3 Access Points are now available in all regions at no additional cost.</p>\n<p>Each S3 Access Point is configured with an access policy specific to a use case or application. For example, you can create an access point for your S3 bucket that grants access to groups of users or applications for your data lake. An S3 Access Point could support a single user or application, or groups of users or applications, allowing separate management of each access point.</p>\n<p>Every access point is associated with a single bucket and contains a network origin control and a Block Public Access control. For example, you can create an access point with a network origin control that only permits storage access from your Virtual Private Cloud, a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud. You can also create an access point with the access point policy configured to only allow access to objects with a defined prefix, such as “finance”.</p>\n<p>Because each access point contains a unique DNS name, you can now address existing and new buckets with any name of your choice that is unique within the AWS account and region. Using access points that are restricted to a VPC, you can now have an easy, auditable way to make sure S3 data stays within your VPC.

A CloudFormation template describes your desired resources and their dependencies so you can launch and configure them together as a stack. You can use a template to create, update, and delete an entire stack as a single unit, as often as you need to, instead of managing resources individually. You can manage and provision stacks across multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions.</p>\n<p>You can manage resource scaling by sharing CloudFormation templates to be used across your organization, to meet safety, compliance, and configuration standards across all AWS accounts and regions. Templates and parameters enable easy scaling so you can share best practices and company policies. Additionally, CloudFormation StackSets enables you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple AWS accounts and Regions, with a single operation.</p>\n<p>To further automate resource management across your organization, you can integrate CloudFormation with other AWS services, including AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control, AWS Config for compliance, and AWS Service Catalog for turnkey application distribution and additional governance controls. Integrations with CodePipeline and other builder tools let you implement the latest DevOps best practices and improve automation, testing, and controls.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for managing and maintaining the network resource</strong> - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.</p>\n<p>Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS-like layer on top of AWS's IaaS services which abstracts away the underlying EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, auto-scaling groups, etc. This makes it a lot easier for developers, who don't want to be dealing with all the systems stuff, to get their application quickly deployed on AWS.</p>\n<p>CloudFormation, on the other hand, doesn't automatically do anything. It's simply a way to define all the resources needed for deployment in a huge JSON/YAML file. So a CloudFormation template might create two Elastic Beanstalk environments (production and staging), a couple of ElasticCache clusters, a DynamoDB table, and then the proper DNS in Route53.</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Config for managing and maintaining the network infrastructure</strong> - AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.</p>\n<p>AWS Config records details of changes to your AWS resources to provide you with a configuration history. You can use the AWS Management Console, API, or CLI to obtain details of what a resource’s configuration looked like at any point in the past. AWS Config will also automatically deliver a configuration history file to the Amazon S3 bucket you specify.</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Service Catalog for managing and maintaining the network infrastructure</strong> - AWS Service Catalog was developed for organizations, IT teams, and managed service providers (MSPs) that need to centralize policies. It allows IT, administrators, to vend and manage AWS resources and services. For large organizations, it provides a standard method of provisioning cloud resources for thousands of users. It is also suitable for small teams, where front-line development managers can provide and maintain a standard dev/test environment.</p>\n<p>Administrators use AWS Service Catalog to create catalogs of products by importing AWS CloudFormation templates. An end-user with access to a portfolio can use the AWS Management Console to find a standard dev/test environment product, for example, in the form of an AWS CloudFormation template, then manage the resulting resources using the AWS CloudFormation console. The products in Service Catalog are CloudFormation templates. Service Catalog can only allow product creation from within the catalog whereas CloudFormation is more seamless for automating infrastructure.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14422151/what-is-the-difference-between-elastic-beanstalk-and-cloudformation-for-a-net-p\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14422151/what-is-the-difference-between-elastic-beanstalk-and-cloudformation-for-a-net-p</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/faqs/</a></p>\n", "section": "Domain 3: Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation", "type": "radio"}, {"question": "<p>A SysOps Administrator has created AWS CloudFormation StackSets to be used in different target accounts spread across AWS Regions.</p>\n<p>Which of the following statements are correct for creating and configuring the StackSets (Select two)?</p>\n", "answers": ["For stack sets created with service-managed permissions, you don't have to create the necessary IAM roles", "Stack sets can be created using either self-managed, service-managed or resource-managed permissions", "When you delete stacks from your stack set but save them to run independently, such stacks need to be maintained at individual resource level and are unavailable in CloudFormation", "You must set up a trust relationship between the administrator and target accounts before creating stacks in target accounts", "For stack sets created using self-managed permissions, you don't have to create the necessary IAM roles"], "correct_answer": ["For stack sets created with service-managed permissions, you don't have to create the necessary IAM roles", "You must set up a trust relationship between the administrator and target accounts before creating stacks in target accounts"], "explanation": "<p>Correct options:</p>\n<p><strong>For stack sets created with service-managed permissions, you don't have to create the necessary IAM roles</strong> - Stack sets can be created using either self-managed permissions or service-managed permissions.

A hardware security module (HSM) is a specialized security device that generates and stores cryptographic keys.</p>\n<p>You should use AWS CloudHSM when you need to manage the HSMs that generate and store your encryption keys. In AWS CloudHSM, you create and manage HSMs, including creating users and setting their permissions. You also create the symmetric keys and asymmetric key pairs that the HSM stores.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>KMS</strong> - If you need to secure your encryption keys in a service backed by FIPS-validated HSMs, but you do not need to manage the HSM, you should use AWS Key Management Service (KMS).</p>\n<p>When you encrypt data, you need to protect your encryption key. If you encrypt your key, you need to protect its encryption key. Eventually, you must protect the highest level encryption key (known as a master key) in the hierarchy that protects your data. That's where AWS KMS comes in.</p>\n<p>KMS lets you create, store, and manage customer master keys (CMKs) securely. Your CMKs never leave AWS KMS unencrypted. To use a CMK in a cryptographic operation, you call KMS.</p>\n<p>KMS does not offer a self-managed encryption module.</p>\n<p><strong>S3 SSE</strong> - Server-side encryption protects data at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it rotates regularly. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available to encrypt your data, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256).</p>\n<p>S3 SSE does not offer a self-managed encryption module.</p>\n<p><strong>GuardDuty</strong> - GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS account. GuardDuty analyzes billions of events across your AWS accounts from AWS CloudTrail (AWS user and API activity in your accounts), Amazon VPC Flow Logs (network traffic data), and DNS Logs (name query patterns). GuardDuty cannot be used to segregate the environment your employees work in based on the department they belong to.</p>\n<p>How GuardDuty Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/Products/product-name/diagrams/product-page-diagram-Amazon-GuardDuty_how-it-works.4370200b49eddc34d3a55c52c584484ceb2d532b.png\"/>\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/\">https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/</a></p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/introduction.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/introduction.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/crypto/latest/userguide/awscryp-choose-hsm.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/crypto/latest/userguide/awscryp-choose-hsm.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/crypto/latest/userguide/awscryp-choose-kms.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/crypto/latest/userguide/awscryp-choose-kms.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html</a></p>\n", "section": "Domain 4: Security and Compliance", "type": "radio"}, {"question": "<p>Your company's main website is deployed on Amazon S3, and distributed by CloudFront.

Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources, such as CloudFront distributions and Amazon S3 buckets. They also let you route traffic from one record in a hosted zone to another record.</p>\n<p>Unlike a CNAME record, you can create an alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace, also known as the zone apex. For example, if you register the DNS name example.com, the zone apex is example.com.

This gives you extra capacity to handle traffic spikes without maintaining an excessive number of idle resources.</p>\n<p>You can configure your Auto Scaling group to scale dynamically to meet this need by creating a scaling policy. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can then scale out your group (add more instances) to deal with high demand at peak times, and scale in your group (run fewer instances) to reduce costs during periods of low utilization.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Configure ASG to use predictive scaling</strong> - You can also use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in combination with AWS Auto Scaling to scale resources across multiple services. AWS Auto Scaling can help you maintain optimal availability and performance by combining predictive scaling and dynamic scaling (proactive and reactive approaches, respectively) to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity faster. Scaling based on demand is a direct way to achieve the current requirement and hence is the correct option.</p>\n<p><strong>Configure ASG to scale based on a schedule</strong> - Scaling by schedule means that scaling actions are performed automatically as a function of time and date.

Policy-2 allows updates to all resources except for the MyDatabase, which is denied by default.</p>\n<p>If a stack policy includes overlapping statements (both allowing and denying updates on a resource), a Deny statement always overrides an Allow statement.
