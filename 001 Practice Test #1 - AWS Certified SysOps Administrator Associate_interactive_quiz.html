This is useful for servers that maintain state information in order to provide a continuous experience to clients. To use sticky sessions, the clients must support cookies.</p>\n<p>When a load balancer first receives a request from a client, it routes the request to a target, generates a cookie named AWSALB that encodes information about the selected target, encrypts the cookie, and includes the cookie in the response to the client. The client should include the cookie that it receives in subsequent requests to the load balancer. When the load balancer receives a request from a client that contains the cookie, if sticky sessions are enabled for the target group and the request goes to the same target group, the load balancer detects the cookie and routes the request to the same target. If the cookie is present but cannot be decoded, or if it refers to a target that was deregistered or is unhealthy, the load balancer selects a new target and updates the cookie with information about the new target.</p>\n<p>You enable sticky sessions at the target group level. You can also set the duration for the stickiness of the load balancer-generated cookie in seconds. The duration is set with each request. Therefore, if the client sends a request before each duration period expires, the sticky session continues.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Slow Start Mode when registering the targets to ALB. This assures that the instances get enough time to warm up and hence will not lose the cached data</strong> - By default, a target starts to receive its full share of requests as soon as it is registered with a target group and passes an initial health check.
